# Analyzing eCommerce Business Performance with SQL<br /> 

## Background
In a company, measuring business performance is very important to track, monitor, and assess the success or failure of various business processes. Therefore, this mini project will analyze business performance for an e-Commerce company, taking into account several business metrics, which are customer growth, product quality, and payment types.

##  Objective
- Analyze several metrics related to customer activity, such as the number of active customers, the number of new customers, the number of customers who make repeat orders, and the average transactions made by customers annually.
- Analyzing the quality of products in eCommerce can provide decisions for developing a better business. Explore the performance of each existing product category and how it relates to the company's revenue.
- Analyzing the performance of existing payment types can provide better insight into creating strategic partnerships with payment service providers. Explore the types of payments available and look at the changing trends over the last few years.

## Data Analysis
### Annual Customer Activity Growth Analysis
- The average Monthly Active User (MAU) has increased every year. However, there was a 50% reduction in the increase obtained.
- Total new customers have also increased every year. In line with MAU, new customers also experienced a rapid increase in 2017.
- There was a fluctuating increase in the repeat orders made by customers. The increase fluctuated every year. We saw that the number of customers making repeat orders increased in 2017 and then decreased in 2018.
- The frequency of orders needs to be a concern because it has stayed the same for three years. This happens because the number of customers who repeat orders is still deficient.
- Therefore, **the marketing team needs to pay more attention to increasing the repeat orders, the number of repeat orders, and the frequency of customer orders.**

### Annual Product Category Quality Analysis
- Top Category Revenue: Furniture decor, Bed bath table, Health beauty
- Top Category Orders Cancel: Toys, Sports leisure, Health beauty<br /> 
**2018 became a concern because Health Beauty products emerged as the products with the most significant revenue and the products with the highest cancel order rates.**

### Analysis of Annual Payment Type Usage
There are four types of payment that customers can choose when shopping at this e-commerce: Credit card, Debit Cards, Vouchers, Boleto. Boleto type allows customers to shop in e-commerce without opening a credit or debit card<br />
- Payment with a Credit Card is the most used type of payment every year. The use of the Credit Card payment type increased rapidly in 2017 in line with the rapid increase in e-commerce customers.<br />
- The use of Boleto, Credit Card, and Debit Card payment types has increased every year.
There was a fluctuating increase up and down in the type of Voucher payment. Voucher usage increased in 2017, then decreased in the following year (2018)
