# Hi, nice to meet you
This is my first Virtual Internship about data. This project becomes 1st mini project for Bootcamp Data Science Batch 26's students. I used PostgreSQL for the query and made the table and the visualization done by Google Slide.<br /> When I created this readme, I still studied Tableau. I would like to make another repository for this visualization but use Tableau for the graph.
